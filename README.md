## To Do
### Support Other Games
Currently the dice images used are based off the symbols for Star Wars RPG, I plan to add some of the other images as well as a dropdown to select between them. They all work the same so if your playing another game the symbols will be slightly differnt but will work. Currently I think the only other game that uses this die system is Genesys, or I could be wrong and that could change.

### Make It Pretty
I havn't done much to make it pretty yet and will be improving the appearence.

### GM Altered Pools
Have the players pools check against the Gamemasters pool, so that the gamemaster can set up opposing dice for the roll.

### Expand Into A Game System Module
I would like to start working on a FFG SWR game system module at some point, starting with decent charicter sheets once this is done.
